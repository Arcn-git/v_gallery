## Overview

We aim to provide a web-gallery that gives each piece of art the space and ambience needed to allow an observer to experience it without distractions. A virtual showroom focuses the attention through deliberate design and adaptive ambience. Tags allow users to fill their showrooms according to taste and encourage discovery. Custom artist sites increase interactivity and provide additional means of expression. Collaborations encourages artists to mingle, fuse mediums and build relationships.

A microservice architecture will be used to ensure scalability and fast development cycles. We will use of React for front-end and Spring for back-end development.
